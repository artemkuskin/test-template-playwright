# test-template-playwright

This repository serves as a template for working with "playwright"

All modules with tests are placed in the "tests" folder

## Running tests

```
 "npx playwright test"
```

## View the report

```
"npx playwright show-report"
```

If the test failed, the report will automatically open in your browser where you can see at what stage the error occurred, as well as a screen of the last successful test

## Example
