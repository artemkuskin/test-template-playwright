# test-template-playwright

This repository serves as a template for working with `"playwright"`

All modules with tests are placed in the `"tests"` folder

## Running tests

```
 npx playwright test
```

## View the report

```
npx playwright show-report
```

If the test failed, the report will automatically open in your browser where you can see at what stage the error occurred, as well as a screen of the last successful test
